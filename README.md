# Task Tracker

A **task tracker** built with **Angular** and **.NET**, allowing you to manage and update tickets as you work on them.

## Purpose

This project is made to **showcase my ability to quickly learn new tools** and to **prepare for interviews** involving those technologies. It also felt like the **perfect time** to build my own task tracker—one that lets me handle **new features and bugs more efficiently** by keeping everything in one place and staying on top of what’s in progress, done, or blocked.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** .NET (API)

## What It Does

- Track tasks and tickets for your projects
- Update ticket status and details as you progress
- Manage work items in one place

## Getting Started

- **Frontend:** See the `Frontend` folder for the Angular app.
- **API:** See the `Api` folder for the .NET backend.

Run both to use the full application.
